Rock.create(name:"Caliche", image_url:"https://geology.com/rocks/pictures/calcrete.jpg", description:"Caliche is a shallow layer of soil or sediment in which the particles have been cemented together by the precipitation of mineral matter in their interstitial spaces. The cement is usually calcium carbonate; however, cements of magnesium carbonate, gypsum, silica, iron oxide, and a combination of these materials are known. Caliche is a common feature of arid or semiarid areas throughout the world. In the United States, caliche is a familiar deposit in many parts of the Southwest, especially in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. There, caliche is associated with problems such as poor soil drainage, difficult soil conditions for plant growth, and excavation problems at construction sites. In some locations there are multiple ancient caliche layers in the subsurface. The name 'caliche' originates from a Spanish word for porous materials that have been cemented by calcium carbonate. The name is used to refer to a piece of the material or the layer from which it was broken, or the cement itself that binds the materials together. Caliche is known by many other names, the more common of which are calcrete, hardpan, duricrust, and calcic soil.", price:12, category:"Sedimentary", color:"white", rating:5, quantity:12)
Rock.create(name:"skarn", image_url:"https://geology.com/rocks/pictures/garnet-skarn.jpg", description:"Skarn is a metamorphic rock that has been chemically and mineralogically altered by metasomatism. Metasomatism is the alteration of rocks by hot, chemically-active fluids that flow or diffuse through the rocks and cause recrystallization and compositional change. Skarn commonly forms around the edges of a magma body that intrudes a nearby rock mass. Rocks formed or altered by the interaction of magma, country rock, reactive fluids and heat are known as skarn. Other environments of metasomatic activity are also known to produce skarn.", price:65, category:"Metamorphic", color:"Red", rating:5, quantity:38)

Geodes are hollow, vaguely circular rocks, in which masses of mineral matter (which may include crystals) are secluded.

Rock.create(name:"Septarian Nodule", image_url:"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/Septarian_Nodule.jpg/450px-Septarian_Nodule.jpg", description:'Septarian concretions or septarian nodules, are concretions containing angular cavities or cracks, called "septaria". The word comes from the Latin word septum; "partition", and refers to the cracks/separations in this kind of rock. Some websites incorrectly derive the term from the Latin word septem, meaning "seven". Cracks are highly variable in shape and volume, as well as the degree of shrinkage they indicate. Although it has commonly been assumed that concretions grew incrementally from the inside outwards, the fact that radially oriented cracks taper towards the margins of septarian concretions is taken as evidence that in these cases the periphery was stiffer while the inside was softer, presumably due to a gradient in the amount of cement precipitated. The process that created the septaria that characterize septarian concretions remains unclear. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, including the dehydration of clay-rich, gel-rich, or organic-rich cores; shrinkage of the concretion\'s center; expansion of gases produced by the decay of organic matter; or brittle fracturing or shrinkage of the concretion interior by either earthquakes or compaction. Septaria usually contain crystals, often calcite, that precipitated from circulating solutions. Siderite or pyrite coatings are also occasionally observed on the wall of the cavities present in the septaria, giving rise respectively to a panoply of bright reddish and golden colors.', price:75, category:"Special", color:"brown", rating:3, quantity:48)

They range in size from 1/4 inch to as large as 5 feet in diameter. Generally, they are about the size of oranges. All are similar on the exterior, but no two are alike in pattern, design or color on the inside. The most colorful and beautiful of Thundereggs comes from a small area in Jefferson County in Central Oregon (Pony Butte). In other localities they do not show such brilliant color and gem quality. In spite of their superior quality, only one in an average of twenty cut make outstanding specimens. These show vivid scenes of land and sea fantasies, which besides the bright hues, reveal the appearance of depth and dimension of distance. Cut and polished Thundereggs are beautiful to behold.

The dramatic scenery at the heart of the Lake District is the result of cataclysmic volcanic eruptions in the late Ordovician period. Glacier-sculpted peaks such as Helvellyn may not look like volcanoes but they are entirely composed of lavas and other rocks that are the products of these eruptions and known as the Borrowdale Volcanic Group.

At that time what is now Cumbria is thought to have been an island arc, similar to those in the west Pacific today, formed of a chain of volcanoes close to the boundary of two converging tectonic plates. The lavas were gaseous and rich in silica which led to violent eruptions and explosive flows of red hot ash and molten rock known as pyroclastic flows. When this ash was deposited and compacted it formed a rock called tuff, which is often finely bedded or banded, sometimes as a result of deposition in lakes.

A very fine example of the Banded Ironstone Formation of Western Australia, with beautiful folding.

Banded ironstone provides unique evidence of the early history of life on Earth. It was formed under the sea by iron reacting with oxygen to form iron oxide (rust). This rock therefore provides the first evidence of oxygen appearing in the Earth's atmosphere, the oxygen being produced by rapidly increasing numbers of primitive, single celled algae - the only life forms at that time. These algae were for the first time using sunlight as a source of energy and producing oxygen as a by-product.
